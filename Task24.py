# Task 24

# Create an abstract class called Vehicle
# Create an abstract method called drive_direction()
# Create another class Car that inherits from Vehicle
# Create another class Plane that inherits from Vehicle
# Try running the program and fix the abstract method issues
# Optionally instantiate the Car and Plane method, then invoke the drive_direction() in each of the object instances.
# Hint: the drive_direction() method in your Car should print "Drive forward", while drive_direction() in your Plane class should print "Drive Upward"
